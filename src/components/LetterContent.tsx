Last year on Valentine's Day, I promised you that when the next one came, I would make you a website to express how much I love you. I didn't imagine that this year neither of us would be the other's Valentine. Still, I wanted to keep my word — even if this comes to you in a different way, and at a different time.`,

    content: `I learned the hard way that love alone isn't always enough. Love needs responsibility, stability, and timing. And realizing that was one of the hardest truths of my life. Walking away wasn't weakness — it was the most painful decision I've ever made, because staying without becoming better would have been unfair to you.`,

    content: `I know I took things for granted. I know there were moments when you needed reassurance, security, and strength — and I wasn't fully there yet. For that, I am truly sorry. Not the kind of sorry that wants forgiveness quickly, but the kind that sits with its mistakes and grows from them.`,

With sincerity,
Mohammad`,
